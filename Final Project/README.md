# CS50 Final Project

WeStudy is a web app that connects students who want to study together.

Documentation and design docs can be found in the following folders:

Docs: ./westudy/client/about/documentation/documentation.html
Design: ./westudy/client/about/design/design.html

These files can also be viewed from the url paths /about/documentation and /about/design.

The demo video can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlaeSvk0qFuoeVZxtwa8cK2UkNBKPzil/view?usp=sharing or on the /about page

The site is viewable and usable on both PC and mobile browsers.



#How to view site

There is one way you can view the site i.e. is a local copy.

##Viewing a Local Copy

To view a local copy, you need to go to meteor.com and install meteor.  Then, from the
command line, navigate to the westudy folder and run the command `meteor`.  One the
app builds, it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000
